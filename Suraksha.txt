Data sets are derived from hardware (DHT11) and software polygon generated (AgroMonitoring) soil moisture.

The data recieved from hardware is sent to Crust networks through ESP8266 WiFi module via MQTT server and Node-Red.

Data from the software is transfered to Crust networks directly with API calling.
